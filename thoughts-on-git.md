# Thoughts

This page documents some limitations I experienced using GitHub as a notebook, and solutions/workarounds I used.

#### Criteria

1. Uses `markdown` so that I can type notes/code quickly without having to change font types to <span style="font-family: Courier">Courier</span>
2. Viewable on both desktop (mainly web, desktop app a plus) and mobile

#### Limitations

The upsides are obvious, so I will only list the downsides below.

1. Cannot conveniently bold, italic, underline

2. Cannot copy and paste images - **solved**
using VS Code's Markdown Preview tool

#### Learnings

- using `[TOC]` immediately gives a Table of Contents based on headers, but this doesn't display nicely on GitHub now.
