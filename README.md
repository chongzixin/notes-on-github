- System One (intuitive mind)
- System Two (analytical mind)
- always question your intuitive mind with your analytical mind
- people have much stronger reactions **when a statictic is framed as humans (7 in 10 humans) as compared to percentage (70%)**
- **availability heuristic** - our mind searching for information that is most readily available, though not necessarily the most important
  - Socrates never actually said "I know that I know nothing", we believe it because we have heard of his name and think theres a good chance he said it.
- **cognitive ease** - a statement that is easy to read is more likely to be believed
- **planning fallacy** - we always think everything is going to go according to plan
- **premortem exercise** - imagine that we are 1-2 years in and we executed the plan perfectly, but it was a disaster. Describe the history of the disaster.
- **broad framing** - take several small risks over the long term has much higher likelihood of success compared to huge risk in short term
- arrogant experts/statements are the least trustworthy

- Use the stepping stones of analogy
- Make the strange familiar, and the familiar strange
- Widen your span of relevance
- Practice serendipity
  - `you are more likely to be serendipitous if you have a wide span of attention and a broad range of interests`
  - `Being over-organized, planning your life down to the last minute like a control freak, is inimical to creativity`
- Chance favours only the prepared mind
- Curiosity 
- Keep your eyes open
- Listen for ideas
- Reading to generate ideas
- Keep a Notebook
- Test your assumptions
- Make use of your Depth Mind (intuition)
- Do not wait for inspiration
- Sharpen your analytical mind
  - reframe the question: smallpox vaccinations were invented because the inventor was not thinking about “why did everyone get it”, but “why did cowpox not get it”
- Suspend judgement - criticising too early destroys the creative process
  - `A person is judged not by his or her answers but by the questions they ask.`
- Learn to tolerate ambiguity
- Drift, wait and obey

- Growing New Businesses
  1. can generate returns on capital investors expect
  2. can grow to a scale where it can be significant in the context of overall company
  3. is currently underserved and that Amazon has the capabilities needed to bring **strong customer-facing differentiation** to the marketplace
- Making decisions
  - some decisions can be made with data, such as where a fulfilment centre should be opened and how much savings can be obtained. 
  - **Other decisions rely on judgement**, as the effect of consistently lowering prices have on the business over a five or ten year period cannot be estimated. `Our judgement is that relentlessly returning efficiency improvements and scale economies to customers ... creates a virtuous cycle that leads over the long term to a much more valuable Amazon.com`
- Setting Goals - focus on customer experience, and lesser on business metrics
  - Amazon has 452 goals - 360 have direct impact on customer experience. *revenue* is used 8 times, *free cash flow* 4 times, *net income, gross profit/margin, operating profit* are not used at all
  - Not all these goals will be met
- Invention - outsized returns often come from betting against conventional wisdom, and conventional wisdom is usually right.
- `Outsized returns often comes with betting against conventional wisdom, except conventional wisdom is usually right`.
- Fending off Day 2
  - A good process serves you so that you can serve customers. But if not careful, the process can become the thing.
  - Good inventors and designers deeply understand their customer. *They spend tremendous energy developing the intuition*, through anecdotes than only the averages found on surveys.
- Building a Culture of High Standards
  1. Recognise what good looks like in the domain
  2. Have a realistic expectation of how hard it should be
  - E.g. Writing a memo - when a memo isn't great, it's usually not because the writer cannot recognise the high standard, but instead under-estimating that a good memo can take weeks or more to write.
- Bezos Day One Fund
  - `All my best decisions in business and in life have been made with heart, intuition, and guts, not analysis`

- Good strategy
  - does more than urge us forward toward a goal or vision. It **honestly acknowledges the challenges being faced and provides an approach to overcoming them**. The greater the challenge, the more a good strategy focuses and cooridnates efforts to achieve a powerful competitive punch or problem-solving effect.
  - **contains three elements - diagnosis, guiding policy, coherent action**
